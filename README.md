# -Banking-Account-System
Designed a Banking Account System with deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry functionalities.
The motto of this is "Seamless Integration of Customer and Account Management."

This program effectively demonstrates the concept of encapsulation and object-oriented programming by managing customer and account details through separate classes. The Customer class holds customer-related attributes such as ID, name, and address, while the Account class stores account-related details like account ID, type, and balance. By using constructors, the program ensures that objects are initialized with meaningful values upon creation.

Each class includes a display() method to present stored data, promoting code reusability and modularity. The AccountTest class serves as the driver program, where instances of both Customer and Account are created and displayed, demonstrating the linkage between a customer and their account.

This structured approach makes the program scalable and maintainable, allowing easy enhancements like adding transaction features, interest calculation, or linking multiple accounts to a single customer. It showcases real-world banking system functionalities, emphasizing efficient data management and object-oriented principles in software development.
